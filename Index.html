          Meeting Date:November 5, 2024<br />
          Participants:Niluxsan, Kamal<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> Good morning, Kamal! Thanks for joining me
          today to discuss our backend development tasks.<br />
          <strong>Kamal:</strong> Good morning, Niluxsan! I’m excited to dive
          into this. Where should we start?<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> Let’s begin with the database setup. Have
          you decided on the schema for the user profiles?<br />
          <strong>Kamal:</strong> Yes, I’ve outlined the key fields: name,
          email, password, and role. I suggest we also add timestamps for
          creation and updates.<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> That sounds great. We should ensure
          password hashing for security. Are you planning to use bcrypt for
          that?<br />
          <strong>Kamal:</strong> Absolutely! I think it’s a reliable choice.
          Should we also implement JWT for user authentication?<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> Yes, JWT would be perfect for handling
          sessions securely. We can set it up to expire after a specific time to
          enhance security.<br />
          <strong>Kamal:</strong> Good point! What about our API routes? Do we
          have a clear structure in mind?<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> I propose we start with the basic CRUD
          operations for users. We can expand as needed.<br />
          <strong>Kamal:</strong> Sounds like a solid plan. Let’s make sure to
          document each route for clarity.<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> Definitely! I’ll draft the documentation
          while you work on the schema. When do you think we can have a
          prototype ready?<br />
          <strong>Kamal:</strong> If we can both focus on our tasks, I think we
          could have a basic prototype in a week.<br />
          <strong>Niluxsan:</strong> Perfect! Let’s aim for that. Thanks for
          your input, Kamal!<br />
